**Guessle** is a **programmatic Wordle solver** built in **Bun + TypeScript**.  
Instead of being a Wordle clone, it acts as a helper tool: suggesting the **best next guess** based on feedback until the solution is found.

---

### How It Works
- Starts with a **word set of 14,000+ entries**
- Uses **programmatic filtering** to eliminate invalid words after each guess
- Implements a **best-pick algorithm** that prefers words with varied letters
- Heuristics assign higher scores to words with **more unique characters**, drastically reducing possibilities  
  _(sometimes from 14,000 → 200 in a single guess!)_

This makes Guessle both a problem-solving tool and a fun experiment in algorithmic word filtering.

### Key Features
- Suggests optimal guesses for Wordle
- Efficient word set reduction
- **Zero external dependencies** (only `typescript` for dev)
- Built in just **1–2 hours** as a hobby project
- Includes a **word serializer script** for:
  - Deduplication
  - Filtering to only 5-letter words
